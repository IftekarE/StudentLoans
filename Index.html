            <P>What are student loans? It is a parasite that sticks with its host for their entire life. 
            It is hard to get rid off it is mentally taxing and limits a person’s ability to flourish economically;
            it takes its toll on a person in more ways than one. </br>
            </br>
            Towards the end of 2018, the collective federal student debt was $1.47 trillion, that’s more than auto and credit loans. 
            44.7 million people in the united states have student loans, that’s 1 in every 5 adults. 
            The loan holder demographic consists of the majority being under 30, and senior citizens the age of 60 and over make a significant portion of the loans as well. 
            A reason for this immense age gap is because of high-interest rates often being as high as 13%, on top of that the interests are compounded; 
            most people 7 years after graduating owe more money than originally borrowed.</br>
