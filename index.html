            What are student loans? It is a parasite that sticks with its host for their entire life. 
            It is hard to get rid of it, is mentally taxing and limits a person’s ability to flourish economically; 
            it takes a toll on a person in more ways than one.</br>
            </br>
            Towards the end of 2018, the collective federal student debt was $1.47 trillion, that’s more than auto and credit loans. 
            44.7 million people in the united states have student loans, that’s 1 in every 5 adults. 
            The loan holder demographic consists of the majority being under 30, and senior citizens the age of 60 and over make up a significant portion of the loans as well. 
            A reason for this immense age gap is because of high-interest rates, often being as high as 13%, on top of that the interests are compounded; 
            most people 7 years after graduating from college owe more money than originally borrowed.</br>     
            </br>
            Student loans have a deadly effect on human psychology, according to business insider loan holders are literally killing themselves due to crippling debt. 
            Many have depression, high-stress levels, and sleep deprivation; 
            on top of that, the cost of attending public university has increased $20,000 while the tuition for private universities has doubled. 
            A sizeable portion of students with loans don’t finish college making it so their chances to get a high paying job are drastically lowered 
            along with the fact that it will be difficult to pay off already existing and growing student debt.</br> 
            </br> 
            There is nothing good about student loans; 
            it limits your economic growth, it's mentally taxing, and it is a parasite that is hard to get rid of, 
            many of those who have student debt never finish college making it impossible to pay off their loans.</br>
